You have stumbled across my GitHub! My name is Sam Eigen. I graduated college with a degree in Political Economy and Computer Science in May of 2020!
Ever since then (COVID!) I've been stuck in my room going nuts! How nuts you may ask?
</div>

In the span of this past year, I have:
<ul>
  <li>Learned how to develop, deploy, and manage my full-stack iOS application w/ a super fun and collaborative AGILE team</li>
  <li>Became one of those annoying Vim people (sorry VSCode)</li>
  <li>Received all certifications in a major SIEM - shoutout Sumo Logic!</li>
  <li>Happily joined the PC Master Race. Building a PC is the way to go!<small><a href="https://github.com/k0ley/k0ley/specs.txt">specs if u care</a></small></li>
  <li>Deployed a Flask REST API using AWS Lambda into S3, DynamoDB, RDS, SES, etc.</li>
  <li>Somehow became a crypto guy. Not really sure when/why this happened, but we're rolling with it. <small>s/o environmentally friendly blockchain tech</small></li>

</ul>
